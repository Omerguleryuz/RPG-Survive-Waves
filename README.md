# RPG - Survive Waves

Hello,
I made a simple survive-waves project.
There is only one type of enemy which is the "Skeleton Minion"
The game is played by "w, a, s, d" keys to move and a left mouse click to attack. I did not add lots of features and tried to keep the project simple like a template. My main focus was to
make the game mechanic itself. More enemy types, levels, different type of waves and different characters could be added
I have focused on implementing OOP and SOLID. More specifically interfaces, inheritance, and abstract classes.
